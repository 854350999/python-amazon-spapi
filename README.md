# python-amazon-spapi

Python toolkit for working with Amazon's Selling Partner API (SP-API)

This project is just a starter, with no usable code at the moment. If you wish to make your own client for the time being, please make use of [Amazon's SP-API Swagger models](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-models), as well as their [documentation](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs).

If you have a need to connect to Amazon seller services and can use MWS (legacy service), please have look at our other project, [python-amazon-mws][1].
