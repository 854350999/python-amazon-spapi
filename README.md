# python-amazon-spapi

Python toolkit for working with Amazon's Selling Partner API (SP-API)

This project is just a starter, as the SP API is in documentation preview mode only (no services live yet) as of this writing.

If you have a need to connect to Amazon seller services, please take a look at our other project, [python-amazon-mws][1].
